# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

---

## 🚀 Get Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the app

```bash
npx expo start
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## 🔧 Firebase & Navigation Setup

To install all required packages for Firebase and React Navigation, run:

```bash
npx expo install firebase @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth @react-native-firebase/firestore
```

## 🧼 Reset Project

To reset and start fresh:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory.
